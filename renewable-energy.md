## Renewable energy projects
Renewable energy projects are critical for addressing climate change, reducing dependence on fossil fuels, and creating a sustainable energy future. Here are various types of renewable energy projects across different technologies :
# Solar Energy Projects : 
1. utility-scale solar farms : develop large-scale solar photovoitaic farms to generate electricity for the grid.
2. Community solar installations : Implement community solar projects that allow multiple stakeholders to benefit from shared solar resources.
3. Solar rooftop installations : promote the installation of solar panels on residential, commercial, and industrial rooftops to harness solar energy locally.

## Wind energy projects : 
1. Onshore wind farms : build onshore wind farms with multiple wind turbines to generate electricity.
2. Offshore wind farms : Develop offshore wind projects in coastal areas with high wind potential to harness energy from wind turbines at sea.
3. Wind turbine repowering : upgrade and repower existing wind turbines to enhance efficiency and extend their operational life.
